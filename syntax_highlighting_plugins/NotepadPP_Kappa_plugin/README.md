# NotepadPP_Kappa_plugin

A plugin for syntax highlighting of the [Kappa language](https://kappalanguage.org) for [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org).

This was designed for highlighting edit-notation operations, introduced in the Kappa Simulator v4, while also supporting legacy chemical-notation operations.
