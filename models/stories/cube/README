Command-line:
KaSim -i cube.ka -seed 611463625 -e 10000 -d expected-output

In this example, each A has three sites which can be activated or not. 
A configuration can be seen as the vertice of a cube, put the movement between these vertices are constrained. 

The observable can be triggered by activating x, then z. 
Or by activating y, then activating x, then activating z, then desactivating x, then deactivating y, then activating x. 

Both ways are compressed in the same causal flow.
