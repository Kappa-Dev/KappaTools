#In this model 
#A can turn into C and C can turn into A
#A and B can form a heterodimmer by connecting their two x(s), and their two y(s) concurrently. 
#Then, they can swap these links to bind a site x to the site y of the other agent, and vice versa (which triggers the observable).

#There is only one causal flow. 

#KaSim will fails if actions are not interpreted in the proper order in strong compression
