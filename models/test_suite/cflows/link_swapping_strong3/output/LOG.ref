+ Loading trace
	- removing events occurring after the last observable: nothing has changed 
+ Producing causal compressions
	- splitting initial events: nothing has changed 
	- simplify the trace, 50 events 
		- start iteration 1, 50 events remaining 
				- alpha-conversion
				- detecting siphons: +5 events 
				- alpha-conversion
				- cutting concurrent events: -11 events 
				- detecting pseudo inverse events: nothing has changed 
		- start iteration 2, 44 events remaining 
				- alpha-conversion
				- detecting siphons: +2 events 
				- alpha-conversion
				- cutting concurrent events: -2 events 
				- detecting pseudo inverse events: nothing has changed 
	- a fixpoint has been reached, 44 events remaining 
	- blackboard generation
